Configuring Screen Saver to not appear in Xwindow mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Stop text terminals from blanking
From GUI, go to Screensave, and set to none. This will keep the pi screen from blanking out

I had no luck with these, but left the config set this way anyways.
change in /etc/kbd/config these two:
BLANK_TIME=0
POWERDOWN_TIME=0

Stop Xsession from blanking
Additional info https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Di ... _Signaling
Add these lines to /etc/xdg/lxsession/LXDE/autostart
@xset s noblank 
@xset s off 
@xset -dpms
